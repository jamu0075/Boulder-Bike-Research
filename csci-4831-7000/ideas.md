I would like to understand how the people of Boulder ride their bikes.

My research questions are:

Q1: How many people are riding their bikes? How has this changed in the past 3 years?

Q2: Where are people riding their bikes? What are the conditions of low traffic areas? High traffic?

Q3: When are people riding their bikes? Is there any bike congestion? 

The data I would use is provided by the city of Boulder. They provide data on biker location/direction for major intersections as well as multi-use bike paths.
These data sets are updated in realtime every 15 minutes starting 3 years ago.

A potential risk I face is being able to accurately map multi-use path usage since the dataset is a bit messy. From personal experience I am aware that these paths
are typically used more often than bike lanes, they make for a better ride. If I am unable to get anything useful from the path dataset I hope to use the street data 
provided to map biker routes and potentially infer whether or not a path enty is used.
