All of the work done for this project can be found in the projects directory. Once inside you will find a few scripts and jupyter notebooks.

'data_collection_bikers.py'  is used to pull the data from the web while 'data_collection_weather.py' requires a manual download. Instructions to download and clean the text file for the weather data can be found in the script. 

After the raw data has been downloaded/cleaned you can run 'data_collection_weather.py' to prepare the text file for analysis. Running the 'data_munging_bikers.py' script will automatically pulled the latest biker data and clean it, returning a clean csv.

At this point you should have everything you need to run the anaysis' found in the notebooks, data_exploration_1 more specifically.
